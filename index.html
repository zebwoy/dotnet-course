            <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
            <p>It's a concept of OOPs which allows us to perform a single action in different ways. In other words,
                polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations. The word “poly” means
                many and “morphs” means forms, So it means many forms.</p>
            <p>Polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:</p>
            <li>Compile-time Polymorphism</li>
            <li>Runtime Polymorphism</li>
            <p>Example: Lets take the '+' (plus) operator</p>

            <h3>Implicit and Explicit</h3>
            <p>
                In C#, "implicit" and "explicit" refer to how type conversions are performed between different data
                types.
            </p>
            <p>
                An implicit conversion occurs automatically, without requiring any special syntax or method call. It
                happens when the conversion is safe and doesn't result in any data loss. For example, converting an
                integer to a float is an implicit conversion, since the float data type can represent all the values of
                an integer. In C#, implicit conversions are handled by the compiler, and they happen automatically when
                needed.
            </p>
            <p>Explicit conversion occurs manually and requires a specific syntax or method call, and is used when
                converting between data types that may not be safe to convert or could result in data loss. For example,
                converting a float to an integer is an explicit conversion. This type of conversion can be performed
                using <span class="yellow-highlight">casting syntax ((int)floatValue)</span> or by calling a <span
                    class="yellow-highlight">conversion method (ToInt32(floatValue))</span>.</p>

                <li id="mvc-info" class="info">Model-View-Controller (MVC): MVC is a software architectural pattern used in
                    web
                    application
                    development. The basic idea behind MVC is to separate different parts of an application into three
                    components: the Model, View, and Controller. The Model represents the data and business logic of an
                    application, the View represents the user interface, and the Controller handles user input and manages
                    the communication between the Model and View.
                    <p>Example: Think of a restaurant that uses an online ordering system. The menu and ordering form (View)
                        are displayed on the customer's screen, the customer selects the items they want (Controller), and
                        the system processes the order and sends it to the kitchen (Model).</p>

                <li id="components-info" class="info">Components: Components are reusable software parts that can be used to
                    build larger
                    software systems. In
                    the context of ASP.NET Framework MVC, components are typically pre-built libraries that can be added to
                    an application to provide additional functionality.
                    <p>Example: Think of a Lego set that comes with different pre-built pieces (components) like wheels,
                        doors, and windows. These pieces can be used to build different types of vehicles (application).</p>

                <br>
                <li id="routing-engine-info" class="info">Routing engine: A routing engine is a component that maps incoming
                    HTTP requests to the appropriate
                    controller action. The routing engine is responsible for determining which controller and action should
                    handle a particular request based on the URL and other factors.
                    <p>Example: Imagine you are driving in a city and want to find a particular store. You use a map app on
                        your phone (routing engine) to enter the store's address (URL) and the app shows you the best route
                        to get there.</p>

                <br>
                <li id="controller-info" class="info">Controller: In ASP.NET Framework MVC, a controller is a component that handles
                    incoming HTTP requests
                    and generates an HTTP response. The controller is responsible for interacting with the Model to retrieve
                    or update data, and for selecting the appropriate View to display the response to the user.
                    <p>Example: If you order a pizza from a restaurant's online ordering system, the system's controller
                        would receive your order and use the Model to update the restaurant's database with your order
                        information. Then, the controller would select the appropriate View to show you a confirmation page.

                    web browser. The View engine takes data from the Model and generates an HTML page that is sent back to
                    the user.
                    <p>Example: If you search for a product on an e-commerce website, the View engine would take the data
                        from the Model (product name, price, description, etc.) and generate an HTML page that shows the
                        product details to you.</p>

                <br>
                <li id="model-binder-info" class="info">Model binder: A Model binder is a component that maps data from incoming HTTP requests to the
                    appropriate Model object. The Model binder is responsible for converting the data in the HTTP request
                    (e.g., form data, query string parameters) into an object that can be used by the Controller.
                    <p>Example: If you fill out a form on a website to create an account, the Model binder would take the
                        data you entered (name, email, password, etc.) and map it to an object that can be used by the
                        Controller to create your account.</p>

                <li id="caching-info" class="info">Caching: Caching is the process of storing data in memory so that it can be retrieved more quickly. In
                    the context of web applications, caching can improve performance by reducing the amount of time it takes
                    to generate a response.
                    <p>Example: Imagine you are working on a group project in school and you frequently refer to a book for
                        information. Instead of having to go to the library each time you need to look something up, you
                        decide to keep the book on your desk (cache) so that you can access it more quickly.</p>

                <br>
                <li id="authentication-info" class="info">Authentication: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. In the context of web
                    applications, authentication is typically done by requiring users to enter a username and password, and
                    then verifying those credentials against a database of authorized users.
                    <p>Example: If you want to log in to your online bank account, the system will ask you to enter your
                        username and password (authentication). If the system is able to verify that your credentials are
                        correct, you will be granted access to your account.</p>

                <br>
                <li id="authorization-info" class="info">Authorization: Authorization is the process of determining what actions a user is allowed to perform
                    within an application. This is typically done by assigning roles or permissions to individual users or
                    groups of users.
                    <p>Example: If you work for a company that uses a web-based HR system, your account might have different
                        levels of authorization depending on your role in the company. For example, a manager might have
                        permission to view and edit employee records, while a regular employee might only be able to view
                        their own records.</p>
