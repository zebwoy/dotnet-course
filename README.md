<hr>
This website serves as a virtual notebook in which I have written notes and examples given by <b>Fahad sir</b> on topics relevent to DOTNET technology.<br><br>
Please feel free to use it as a referance and even fork it if need be.<br><br>
Regarding pull requests, I won't be allowing it for now considering the course is live and I will be adding more to the knowledge pool as per my understanding.
Although once the course gets over I'll think about opening pull request.
